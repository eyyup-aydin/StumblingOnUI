# StumblingOnUI
This package is the front end for https://stumblingon.com 

https://stumblingon.com is a Stumble Upon alternative.  You click a button and get a random website.  You can submit your own websites if they are interesting, independent, and fun!

# StumbleService

The StumbleService that powers this front end is a separate project.  I will get it on github and add a link here.

# YouTube

I am making YouTube videos regarding my progress in improving this website on YouTube here - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8iOdboojkUW9klo2m4h3GKCKelDeM7Lc
