# StumblingOnUI
This package is the front end for https://stumblingon.com 

https://stumblingon.com is a Stumble Upon alternative.  You click a button and get a random website.  You can submit your own websites if they are interesting, independent, and fun!

# StumbleServer

The service that powers this front end is a separate project.  Find it here: https://github.com/inteoryx/StumbleServer
